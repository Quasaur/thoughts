# Passage: PRICELESS WISDOM
> [!Passage]
> Blessed is a person who finds wisdom,
> And one who obtains understanding.
> For her profit is better than the profit of silver,
> And her produce better than gold.
> She is more precious than jewels,
> And nothing you desire compares with her.
> Long life is in her right hand;
> In her left hand are riches and honor.
> Her ways are pleasant ways,
> And all her paths are peace.
> She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,
> And happy are those who hold on to her.
