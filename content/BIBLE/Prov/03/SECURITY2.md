# Passage: SECURITY 2
> [!Passage]
> My son, do not lose sight of these—  
    keep sound wisdom and discretion,  
    and they will be life for your soul  
    and adornment for your neck.  
> Then you will walk on your way securely,  
    and your foot will not stumble.  
> If you lie down, you will not be afraid;  
    when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.  
> Do not be afraid of sudden terror  
    or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,      for the LORD will be your confidence  
    and will keep your foot from being caught.
