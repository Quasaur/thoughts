# Table: PASSAGES (md), sorted by File
This table identifies all of the PASSAGES of Divine Wisdom located in the Holy Scriptures Christians refer to as The Holy Bible that have been added to this online Book of Thoughts.

Each Passage has its own file, which includes:
- The content of the Biblical reference
- Information used by the [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin to create the tables used on this site, which includes both the Biblical chapter and verse as well as it's link on [The Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/).

Each PASSAGE is identified by its LEVEL according to the topic catalogue of this site. The Level helps you to understand how all included Passages (and their Topics, which are visible in the Quote Table) are related to each other.

The items in the File and Topic columns are links that can be clicked on to take you to that particular Passage or its Topic.
