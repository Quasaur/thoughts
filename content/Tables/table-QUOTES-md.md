# Table: QUOTES
This table identifies all of the Quotes from my other eight books currently added to the online Book of Thoughts.

Each Quote has its own file, which includes:
- The content of the Quote
- Information used by the [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin to create the tables used on this site, which includes both the name of the book source and it's link on Amazon.

Each Quote is identified by its LEVEL. The Level helps you to understand how all Quotes (and their Topics, which are visible in the Quote File yet not visible in the Quotes Table) are related to each other.

The items in the File column are links that can be clicked on to take you to that particular Quote.
