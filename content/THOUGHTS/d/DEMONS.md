# Thought: DEMONS
> [!Thought-en]
> What happened to the fallen angels will be the unavoidable fate of every human soul that rejects the Grace of Christ.
>  To reject Divine Grace is to eventually become completely graceless, totally ungracious, absolutely unmerciful, frighteningly unnatural, incorrigibly abusive, abysmally insane and hideously demonic.
>  TODAY…IF YOU HEAR HIS ETERNAL VOICE…DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEART!
