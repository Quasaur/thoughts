# Thought: JUSTICE 
> [!Thought]
> You are correct: The Gospel of Jesus Christ is not fair…yet It is just!
> It is not fair that ANY sinner be forgiven their sins and escape the Lake of Fire and Sulfur; yet it is just for The Cross of Christ to atone for the sinner who, by Faith, is nailed on That Selfsame Cross along with Christ! 
> Galatians 2:20
