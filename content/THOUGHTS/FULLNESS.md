# Thought: FULLNESS 
> [!thought]
> Because of Their DIVINE FULLNESS, The Members of The GODHEAD are COMPLETELY IMMUNE to temptation, corruption and sin.
> Through Jesus Christ THAT SAME IMMUNITY is made available to the wretched sinner…provided he or she is willing to ABANDON his or her own “fullness” (self-righteousness, goodness, pride).
