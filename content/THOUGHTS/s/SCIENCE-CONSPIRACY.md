# Thought: SCIENCE CONSPIRACY
> [!Thought-en]
> The gods of the scientific community have deceived us: Einstein’s special and general theories of relativity CONTRADICT each other: either the speed of light is unchangeable or the Earth is, in fact, the center of the known universe!
> Michelson’s two experiments verify the existence of the ETHER…nullifying special relativity entirely!
> A standard model based on a geocentric universe is less complicated, makes more sense and eliminates the need for “dark” matter & energy. “NOTHING”, BY DEFINITION, DOES NOT EXIST.
