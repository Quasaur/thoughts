# Thought: WHEN JESUS RETURNS
> [!Thought-en]
> …and with Him choirs of angels that outnumber demons and humans combined, it’s over (the deception, delusion and lies).
> NOW is the time to turn off the TV, radio and phone.
> NOW is the time for weeping, mourning, repenting, begging for mercy and praying.
