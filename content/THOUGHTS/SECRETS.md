# Thought: SECRETS
> [!Thought]
> The SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE, including immortality and transcendence, are all around you…right under your nose; but without EYES to see and EARS to hear, you will MISS them in the distracting cacophony of earthly “life” and eventually find yourself in an ETERNITY of indescribable misery because you were too busy “doing you.”
> Matthew 7:13,14
