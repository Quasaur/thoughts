# Thought: EMPTINESS
> [!Thought]
> It’s why we eat when we’re not hungry.
> It’s why we watch hours of mindless television and play with ouija boards and horoscopes.
> It’s why we pursue one addiction after another, and there’s only One Cure that will fill that black hole in the core of our being: The Lord Jesus Christ. 
> How insane it is, then, to attend Church for years and NEVER meet Jesus!!!
