# Quote: SO MANY GOSPEL
> [!Quote]
> The fact is that there are many "gospels" floating around in religious sects (both Catholic and Protestant, as well as non-Christian esoterics); most of them not really giving any glory to the Lordship of Jesus Christ nor agreeing with the doctrines handed down by those who were witnesses to His Holy Resurrection.
