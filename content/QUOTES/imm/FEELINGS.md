# Quote: FEELINGS
> [!Quote]
> Your personal neuroses (guilt, shame, depression, bipolar disorder, etc.) notwithstanding, when you pray GOD STOPS WHAT HE’S DOING AND LISTENS! Your perception of His Presence (or lack thereof) is irrelevant; what matters is the truth and your faith in the truth…not your feelings.
