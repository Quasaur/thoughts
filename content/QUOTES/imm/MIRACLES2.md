# Quote: MIRACLES 2
> [!Quote]
> When the One True GOD performs a miracle, that miracle is entirely consistent with His overall Purpose and Agenda; which means that while Divine miracles transcend reason and logic, they do not contradict reason and logicâ€¦a distinction that is critical to discerning between the Finger of GOD and the lying wonders of Satan.
