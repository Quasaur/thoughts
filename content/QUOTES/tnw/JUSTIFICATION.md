# Quote: JUSTIFICATION
> [!Quote]
> Oh My GOD! GOD is justifying the ungodly: that is, He is DECLARING THE UNGODLY LEGALLY JUST for Christ's Sake!! This has nothing to do with feelings, but WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART!!! If you believe in your heart that what was done to Christ in the garden, in the Sanhedrin, before Herod, before Pilate, in the Praetorium and on the Cross was done for YOU, GOD considers you as just as Christ is EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE NOT!!!
