# Quote: FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT
> [!Quote]
> Notice they're not called the Works of the Spirit but the Fruit of the Spirit. The Apostle is drawing a contrast between the WORKS of the flesh and the FRUIT of the Holy Spirit of GOD...subtle yet critical.
> "Works...fruit...what does it matter?"
> Ahhhh...it does matter, and the difference determines the destiny of billions for Heaven or Hell!
