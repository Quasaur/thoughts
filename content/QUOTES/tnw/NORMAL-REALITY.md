# Quote: NORMAL REALITY
> [!Quote]
> Other things happened, but what i most strongly desire to convey to you is that the lives we experience in this world are NOT as real as Eternity. We live in a temporary sub-reality that is the result of humanity being disconnected from our Great and Precious Heavenly Father.
> The experience i was granted is NORMAL REALITY...the environment we were MEANT to be born into and live our lives in!!!
