# Quote: FULL ASSURANCE
> [!Quote]
> i know that KNOWING that you're going to be Saved from the Wrath of GOD is declared heresy by the Roman Catholic Church; if you STUDY A RELIABLE TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE, however, you will see that GOD wants you to be assured and confident of your eternal destiny ([1 John 5:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A13-15&version=KJV))
