# Quote: UNGODLY
> [!Quote]
> And this is what the Bible means by the term "ungodly" ([Psalms 1:4,5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+1%3A4-5&version=ESV)): not that we deliberately choose to spend every waking moment committing atrocities, but that as much as we desire to live good, just and quiet lives, WE'D RATHER DO SO WITHOUT GOD.
