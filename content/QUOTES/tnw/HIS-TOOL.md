# Quote: HIS TOOL
> [!Quote]
> The Truth is this: a small cabal of individuals rule the world; their master is the Devil ([1 John 5:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A19&version=ESV)) and his Masters are the GODHEAD.
> Evil is a tool in the Hand of a Holy GOD, used to accomplish His Good Purpose ([Genesis 50:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&version=ESV); [Romans 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=ESV)).
