# Quote: THE NARROW WAY
> [!Quote]
> As the only means to peace with our Creator, the Narrow Way (the Gospel) must be communicated with clarity and simplicity. Declared properly, the Narrow Way will always push me into a corner and compel me to decide against my self and for GOD.
> The Objective of Salvation is not to get GOD on my side, but to get me to take the side of GOD against my self!
