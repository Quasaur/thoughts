# Quote: THE CALL
> [!Quote]
> That being said, for the last two thousand years GOD has put out a call to every nation, tribe, tongue and people on the face of the planet to turn to His Only-Begotten Son Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of ALL SIN--past, present and future--and to receive The Gift of The Holy Spirit of GOD and embark on the transcendent experience of That Priceless Treasure: a Sinless, Endless Life!
