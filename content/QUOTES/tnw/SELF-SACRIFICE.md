# Quote: SELF-SACRIFICE
> [!Quote]
> Did i drift off topic, Dear Reader? Not at all; the spirit of worship, obedience and self-sacrifice for the Glory of GOD is the product of True, Divinely-given Faith that exists in the heart, and not just the mind. GOD gave up That which was EVERYTHING to Him to love you; and if you truly desire to be filled with His Holy Spirit, That Selfsame Member of the Eternal GODHEAD will inspire you to the same level of self-sacrificial love we see in Christ Himself.
