# Quote: The HEART OF MANKIND
> [!Quote]
> None of our achievements, advances, contributions, virtuous deeds or good intentions make up for our evil hearts (hearts that believe GOD is not necessary to live a fulfilling life) ...else Christ would not have had to present Himself as a Sacrifice in our stead.
