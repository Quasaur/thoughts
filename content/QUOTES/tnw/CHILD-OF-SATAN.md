# Quote: CHILD OF SATAN
> [!Quote]
> It is impossible to be a sinner and not harbor in your heart some lie that you cling to as truth. Do you even now yet see yourself as a "good person" who could "benefit" from having an "advisor" such as Jesus at your side? Or are you willing to admit that you're a child of the Devil, by your very nature damned for Wrath and in DESPERATE NEED of the Only-Begotten Son of GOD's Mercy, Forgiveness and Saving Grace?
