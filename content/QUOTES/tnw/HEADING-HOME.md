# Quote: HEADING HOME
> [!Quote]
> Most people focus on the "deny himself" clause, yet that is NOT the central idea of this statement. To be a disciple of Jesus you must FOLLOW Jesus...but WHERE IS JESUS GOING? In connection to what i said in [Part Fourteen](https://www.clmjournal.com/post/the-narrow-way-part-fourteen-discipleship) regarding Reality, Jesus is RETURNING TO THE FATHER where sin, death and affliction do not exist...and HE IS INVITING YOU TO RETURN THERE WITH HIM!!! This is the HEART of what being "saved" means, with the added benefit of NEVER BEING CAPABLE OF SINNING AGAIN!!!!
