# Quote: LAW-OF-DOUBT
> [!Quote]
> As stated in my book "[IMMUNITY to the Lake of Fire: a No-Nonsense Guide](https://www.clmbooks.life/book-ip)" religion has declared the doctrine of Full Assurance (Once Saved, Always Saved) to not only be a heresy, but an unforgivable sin (Council of Trent, Sixth Session, Chapter XVI, Canons on Justification). That is to say: Doubt itself, the sworn enemy of Faith ([Matthew 14:31](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14%3A31&version=ESV); [James 1:5-8](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A5-8&version=ESV)), is adopted by institutionalized religion as both critical and necessary.
> Gadzooks! What am i missing here? How can i walk with Jesus in full assurance of Faith if He can't even guarantee the completion of the Good Work our Heavenly Father began in me?
