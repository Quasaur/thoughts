# Quote: SCRIPTURE AS HISTORY
> [!Quote]
> The Bible is the most accurate ancient library of its kind, and 1,500 years of so-called "higher criticism" has not proven otherwise. Rather, the reliability and reputation of the Holy Scriptures has only increased with the continuous examination of Their contents.
