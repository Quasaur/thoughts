## Welcome!
WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF THOUGHTS (formerly [The Book of Tweets: Proverbs for the Modern Age]([The Book of Tweets: Proverbs for the Modern Age - Kindle edition by Mitchell, Calvin. Politics & Social Sciences Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com.](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Tweets-Proverbs-Modern-Age-ebook/dp/B00RSE25H2?ref_=ast_author_dp&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fI9TBH2QdtAZfEFHkTvYkZQTvxUFYwGtN4sN8NAuF0G5I0Hw3LfHNChhF0mSiMqIalc-KKbFZJKAWrUqBzn_I8P5XoeBDAtjRV-1GqGYEXANMGwoiP7kBGKA44xmKJAZ_UYD4s7omQv8e5XyorZS3Q.rQVu6PmFMBnPcVm8Z8FLgvDCg9k4nMmRyRiesA9OPnM&dib_tag=AUTHOR)))

Back in January of 2015 i compiled all the Twitter (now called "X") posts i had posted up to that point into an ebook which i made available on Amazon Kindle Unlimited.

Since that time i have made innumerable posts on [various social media platforms](https://www.clmjournal.com/all-the-links)). My vision for the Book of Tweets then became more ambicious: i wanted to create a LIVE site on which ALL of my posted thoughts could be published, read, searched and connected to each other.

Having discovered [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), i was excited to find a platform on which i could broadcast the wisdom i had collected to the world and immediately commenced to transfer the content of The Book of Tweets to an Obsidian vault created for that purpose...

...there was just one small problem: [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)) did not have critical features that the desktop version of Obsidian had inspired so much excitement in me.

Years have come and gone...

...and now I believe that, with the technology provided by the author of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), i now have all the components i need to see my dream come to fruition!

So...here's how to get started:

## The Tables
The best place to start is with the tables. The tables will provide you easy and browsable lists of The Book of Thoughts (formerly The Book of Tweets) content.
