# CONSEQUENCES 
Mercy itself has consequences that never occur to the mind of the selfish, self-obsessed sinner. Mercy means Lucifer becomes Satan. Mercy means Satan seduces a third of Heaven’s angels, damning them to eternal shame. Mercy means allowing Satan to tempt the pure and innocent Adam and his wife Eve. Mercy means thousands of years of death, abuse, rape, torture, starvation, famine, natural and manmade disasters, plague, disease, war, the ripping apart of families, the occult, deep darkness, deception and blindness.
